#School of Data Projects

This is my Github repo for my School of Data projects that I will be building for [Media Monitoring Africa](http://www.mediamonitoringafrica.org/) and [The Con](http://www.theconmag.co.za/). These two organizations were selected to part in our first School of Data workshops to be held in South Africa.

The result of the workshops were several projects that are data driven in nature. For MMA I will be producing to web apps: Agenda Setter and Bona Bana. And for The Con I will be working on a news app based on the Farlam report that came out of the inquirey in to Lonmin Mines.
